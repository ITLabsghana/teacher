# **App Name**: Teacher Management Software

## Core Features:

- Admin Authentication: Secure login interface for administrators.
- Teacher Management: Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for teacher profiles.
- School Management: School input and categorization (KG1, KG2, Basic 1-6, J.H.S 1-3, S.H.S 1-3) managed through a dedicated 'Schools' tab.
- Leave Tracking: Interface for tracking teacher leave requests with start and expected return dates.
- Data Import/Export: Data import/export functionality using Excel for all system data, to enable easy data migration and reporting.
- Automatic Age Calculation: Auto-generation of age based on the Date of Birth field, read-only display of the result.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness, referencing traditional educational environments, but styled in a modern manner.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8EAF6), subtly desaturated, complementing the deep blue and maintaining a light scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#9575CD), an analogous color to the primary blue, differing significantly in saturation to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to create a computerized, scientific feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text for its modern and neutral readability.
- Use a consistent set of modern, minimalist icons for navigation and data representation, providing a clean user experience.
- Implement a tab-based layout for main sections (Teacher Management, School Management, Leave Tracking) and prioritize resume functionality between tabs to enhance user experience.
- Use subtle animations and transitions throughout the UI to provide feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting.
